--- Plant Generator ---
Plant Generator is a tool that takes a collection of categorized data and procedurally builds the description of a plant.

PlantMeshGen uses the same methodology to generate a 3D mesh


-- Inspiration --
PlantGen is inspired by the insane variety of plants. In particular, the varieties between different types of mushrooms, flowers, and cacti are what inspired this project


-- Data Design --
A generatable plant is made up of categorized components

Effectively just a tree of categories where each leaf is a random table with optional weights

Weights:
    Weights can be floating point or integer values
    Weights will be normalized (so you can enter a percent chance for each entry, or a set of ratios)
    If no weights are specified, every entry has equal probability

Ranges:
    Ranges will return normalized percentages for values in the range
    A simple two-value range will return how much of each value has been generated
        ex: A range of White and Black could return 20% white, 80% black (ie: dark grey)
    Three value ranges will similarily split between three values



-- Syntax --
Undecided. Might use YAML, since it seems a bit cleaner and easier to read / write than JSON or XML
Could also do something custom, but using something that already exists gives the benefit of syntax highlighting
