--- Plant Generator ---
PlantGenerator is a tool that takes a collection of categorized data and procedurally builds the description of a plant.

Despite the name, the PlantGenerator is general enough that it could generate anything out of a random set of properties (ex: a random Taste for a given plant)


-- Inspiration --
PlantGen is inspired by the insane variety of plants. In particular, the varieties between different types of mushrooms, flowers, and cacti are what inspired this project


-- Data Design --
A generatable plant is made up of categorized components

Effectively just a tree of categories where each leaf is a random table with optional weights

Weights:
    Weights can be floating point or integer values
    Weights will be normalized (so you can enter a percent chance for each entry, or a set of ratios)
    If no weights are specified, every entry has equal probability

Ranges:
    Ranges will return normalized percentages for values in the range
    A simple two-value range will return how much of each value has been generated
        ex: A range of White and Black could return 20% white, 80% black (ie: dark grey)
    Three value ranges will similarily split between three values

Composite Plants:
  Plants can contain an entire generated plant as a property
    ex: a small plant might generate a root, grass, and flower from three separate data files

  This allows the user to factor out reusable components into their own file.

  Not sure which keyword to use. Probably "Include"
    ex:
      "Properties": [
          {
              "Name": "Root"
              "Include": "some/filepath/plant_root.json"
          }
      ]



-- Syntax --
I want to use YAML, but yaml-cpp refuesd to work in MSVC
Went with JSON for now, but I'll probably support both
