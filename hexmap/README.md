# Hexmap
A code library meant for storing and rendering hexagon tilemaps for use in various applications. The original inspiration for starting the project was the desire to have a user-friendly hexagon map editor to create overworld maps for tabletop roleplaying games.


Hexmap is currently being developed on Windows and Linux (Mint/Ubuntu) with plans to support mobile platforms for hexmap viewing (but probably not editing).
